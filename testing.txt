Testing. Copy paste from datasheet with comments:

Interval Timers (Timer A, Timer B):
1. Each interval timer consists of a 16-bit read-only
Timer Counter and a 16-bit write-only Timer Latch.
2. Data written to the timer are latched in the Timer Latch, while
3. data read from the timer are the present contents of the
Timer Counter.
4. The timers can be used independently 
5. or linked for extended operations.

Start/Stop: OK
A control bit allows the timer to be started or stopped
by the microprocessor at any time.

PB On/Off: timerab ok, portb connected to the timers not tested.
1. A control bit allows the timer output to appear on a
PORT B output line (PB6 for TIMER A and PB7 for
TIMER B).
2. This function overrides the DDRB control
bit and forces the appropriate PB line to an output.

Toggle/Pulse: tested ok.
1. A control bit selects the output applied to PORT B.
2. On every timer underflow the output can either toggle or
generate a single positive pulse of one cycle duration.
3. The Toggle output is set high whenever the timer is
started and is set low by RES. 

One-Short/Continuous: tested ok
1. A control bit selects either timer mode.
2. In one-shot mode, the timer will count down from the
   latched value to zero, generate an interrupt, reload the latched
   value, then stop.
3. In continuous mode, the timer will count from the latched value
   to zero, generate an interrupt, reload the latched value and
   repeatthe procedure continuously .

Force Load: tested ok
A strobe bit allows the timer latch to be loaded into the
timer counter at any time, whether the timer is running or
not.

Input Mode: tested ok
1. Control bits allow selection of the clock used to decrement
   the timer,
2. TIMER A can count 02 clock pulses or
   external pulses applied to the CNT pin.
3. TIMER B can count 02 pulses, external CNT pulses,
   TIMER A underflow pulses or TIMER A underflow pulses
   while the CNT pin is held high.
4. The timer latch is loaded into the timer on any timer
   underflow, on a force load or following a write to the high
   byte of the prescaler while the timer is stopped.
5. If the timer is running, a write to the high byte will load the
   timer latch, but not reload the counter.
