all my latest files are now released.
The changes are from 2019-2020, when I did the video series and tested it on real hardware using
a xilinx nexys 2 dev board, and a custom built test cart with many unit tests testing the logic and functionality like timers.
I've kept these changes close to my heart in hope of trying them myself on a the vhdl6526 pcb. Then came other projects doing the same thing.

Now Dag Lem has released a reDIP-CIA PCB. I wonder if I can convert my VHDL files to work on it.
